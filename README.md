# Robotic Arm Manipulator – Inverse Kinematics (Raspberry Pi)

This project is a hands-on robotics learning project where I built and programmed
a simple robotic arm manipulator and controlled it using inverse kinematics.

The goal: Apply Theoritical classroom knoweledge into practical. To understand how joint angles are computed and translated into
physical movement on real hardware.

This project was developed and tested directly on a Raspberry Pi.


## 📌 Project Overview
- Built a small multi-joint robotic arm (3 DOF)
- Implemented inverse kinematics to calculate joint angles
- Controlled servo motors through Python code
- Tested and debugged movement on real hardware


## 🧠 What I Learned
- Fundamentals of inverse kinematics for robotic manipulators
- Design, 3D printing and CAD
- Mapping Cartesian end-effector positions to joint angles
- Servo motor control and calibration
- Running robotics control code on microcontroller
- Debugging hardware–software interaction


## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4b, Servo Motors (cheap blue ones), PLA model, PCA 9685 (to control motors), external power
- **Software:** Python
- **Concepts:** Inverse Kinematics, Coordinate Geometry, Control Logic

## Future Goal
- Design and built a fully functioning arm/ manipulator
- Implement motion smoothing / trajectory planning
- implement VLA (vision language model)


## 📚 Notes
This project was built as a learning exercise to gain hands-on experience with
robotics and inverse kinematics. The implementation prioritizes clarity and
learning over optimization or production-level performance.
